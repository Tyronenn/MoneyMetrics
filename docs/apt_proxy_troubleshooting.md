# Fixing `apt-get update` Errors

When running `apt-get update`, you may encounter errors such as:

```
The repository 'http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble InRelease' is not signed.
```

## When should `apt-get update` be used?

`apt-get update` refreshes the package index on Debian-based systems such as
Ubuntu. Run it when you need to install or upgrade system packages on a
Debian/Ubuntu machine. Typical scenarios include:

* **Setting up developer workstations or CI runners** that rely on Ubuntu or
  Debian and need additional APT packages.
* **Building containers or virtual machines** where you plan to install extra
  packages after provisioning the image.

The command **should not** be used in these cases:

* **Non-Debian operating systems** (macOS, Windows, Alpine, etc.) that do not
  use APT.
* **Environments with all required packages pre-installed**, where updating
  the package index provides no benefit.
* **Restricted or offline environments** where outbound network access is
  blocked; `apt-get update` cannot reach the package mirrors and will fail.

If your workflow does not involve installing new system packages or you are on
a platform without `apt`, you can skip running this command.

## Root Cause
In this environment, the `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` environment variables are set to `http://proxy:8080`, which points to a
proxy that returns `403 Forbidden` to outbound requests. Because the proxy blocks access to the Ubuntu archives, `apt` cannot retrieve the signed `InRelease` files and reports that the repository is not signed.

## Solution
1. Remove the proxy environment variables so `apt` can connect directly to the repositories:
   ```bash
   unset http_proxy https_proxy HTTP_PROXY HTTPS_PROXY
   ```
2. Ensure the system sources use `https` URLs:
   ```bash
   sudo sed -i 's|http://|https://|g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources
   sudo sed -i 's|http://|https://|g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list
   ```
3. Retry the update:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

If network access is still blocked after these steps, the container's network policy may prevent external connections and you will need to work without `apt`.
